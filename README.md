chRomHMM
========

this WAS a package for manipulating ChromHMM output in R, but that's a little too close to the name of the Real Thing, so I changed it.

The package has been renamed 'chromophobe' and the renamed repository is at 
https://github.com/ttriche/chromophobe

If you are a collaborator and don't have access to chromophobe, email me.

thanks,
