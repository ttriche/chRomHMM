chRomHMM
========

this WAS a package for manipulating ChromHMM output in R, but then it dawned on
me that it's a little too close to the name of the Real Thing, so I changed it.

Now the package has been renamed 'chromophobe' (easy to remember) & the repo is:
https://github.com/ttriche/chromophobe (may be public by the time you read this)

If you are a collaborator and don't have access to chromophobe, email me.

thanks,
